            AgroConsultant - an intelligent system that would consider environmental parameters (temperature, rainfall, farm’s latitude, longitude, altitude and distance from the sea) and soil characteristics (pH value, soil type and thickness of aquifer and topsoil) before recommending the most suitable crop to the user.       
            Crop recommendation is one of the most important aspects of precision agriculture.Precision agriculture seeks to define these criteria on a site-by-site basis in order to address crop selection issues.
            However, in agriculture, it is critical that the recommendations made are correct and precise, as errors can result in significant material and capital loss.
